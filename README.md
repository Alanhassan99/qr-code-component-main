## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I've learned about using vh which I needed to center my component vertically in the body. I've also learned to take a text and split it into different spans so that I can make them appear over each other in a way that the texts have different width. Similar to white-space: pre-wrap. 


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```
FIRST SNIPPET: body{
      background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
      display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
        min-height: 100vh;
        justify-content: center;
    }

    SECOND SNIPPET: <div class="under-heading">
    <span class="one">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend</span>
    <span class="two">Mentor and take your coding skills to</span>
    <span class="three">the next level</span></div>
```
### Continued development
I would like to learn more about responsivness.
